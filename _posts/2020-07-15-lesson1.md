Basic Jupyter note book command and fast.ai library functions


## Lesson 1
​
To auto reload
​
```
%reload_ext autoreload
%autoreload 2
%matplotlib inline
```
​
`?function-name`: Shows the definition and docstring for that function  
`??function-name`: Shows the source code for that function
​
`help(fn_name)` [fast.ai](http://fast.ai) helper fn like man  
`doc(fn_name)` gives the details informations and links to docs
​
Line magic star with `‘%’%timeit [i+1 for i in range(1000)]` : Runs a line ten thousand times and displays the average time it took to run it.  
`%debug`: Allows to inspect a function which is showing an error using the Python debugger.
​
`path.ls()` Helper to do ‘ls’ on Path(python data type) object  
You can append to path object like path/'images'
​
```
data = ImageDataBunch.from_name_re(path_img, fnames, pat, 
            ds_tfms=get_transforms(), size=224, bs=bs).normalize(imagenet_stats)
```
​
size=224 : standard image size because of GPU limitation  
Return a data bunch object which will used in most of [fast.ai](http://fast.ai) course
​
`get_transforms`  
Tranforms the image to square and also does centre cropping and a lot more
​
`normalize(imagenet_stats)`  
Normalises the color RGB so that model can train well, if model is not working well try to normalise.
​
`data.classes` = lists all the classes (ex different breeds) of data  
`data.c` = lists the number of classes = len(data.classes)
​
`learn = cnn_learner(data, models.resnet34, metrics=error_rate)`  
cnn_learner = a type of convolution neural network  
Resnet34 is type of model/architecture. Works almost every time two major ones resnet\_34 and resnet\_50 number denotes the layer size
​
metrics = things to print can be error_rate or accuracy
